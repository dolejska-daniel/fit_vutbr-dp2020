# Master's Thesis / Diplomová práce
Anonymisation software, like Tor or I2P, creates a~suitable environment for criminality to thrive on the Internet.
Dark marketplaces (aka cryptomarkets) are one such example of criminal activities.
They act as an intermediary in trade of illegal goods and services.
This thesis focuses on forensic analysis of such web services and subsequent extraction of non-trivial information about the realised orders and payments from selected marketplaces.
The main goal is the ability to pinpoint the time interval when an order has been completed on selected marketplaces and its following correlation with cryptocurrency blockchains.
The implemented program provides fully automated non-stop monitoring of selected cryptomarkets.
This, under certain conditions, allows detection of realised orders, detailed product and vendor monitoring and collection of various meta-data entries.
Acquired data can be used by law enforcement agencies as a~support evidence regarding operation of the selected cryptomarkets and their vendors.
